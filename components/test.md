Certainly! Below is an example demonstrating how you can configure lazy loading for a new feature in an Angular application, especially using the composable storefront approach:\n\n```typescript\n\n// Define the feature module with lazy loading in your app.module.ts or a similar configuration module\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [\n // Other imports...\n ],\n providers: [\n provideConfig({\n featureModules: {\n newFeature: {\n module: () =>\n import('./path/to/feature/nâ€¦ SpartacusFeaturesModule {}\n\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `newFeature` is defined as a lazy-loaded module.\n- The module is dynamically imported using `() => import('./path/to/feature/new-feature.module')`.\n- Dependencies for the feature can be similarly lazy-loaded.\n- Specific CMS components related to the feature are listed under `cmsComponents`.\n\nThis setup ensures that the new feature and its dependencies are only loaded when needed, thus optimizing the initial load time of your application."
